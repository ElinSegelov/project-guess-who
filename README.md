# Guess Who?!

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
This assignment was to set up the logic for a Guess Who game, including:
- setting a secret character (the Who to find)
- checking selected questions to an array of possible characters and filter the ones to keep, according to the selected question and alert the player what is filterd

## The problem

We were given an array of "character" objects. I've used filter method together with if/else statements to update the characters possible to guess. Using method setInverval method I've created a timer that keeps track of the time spent playing the game.
